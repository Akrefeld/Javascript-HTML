            <b>Please read the following instructions carefully!</b><br>
            <br>We will ask you to choose one out of two used cars that you prefer in the following task.<br>
            <br>To inform your choice you will receive the following information in a table like the following:
            <img src="images/instruction_example.png" width="600" heigth="550" /><br>
            <br>For each car you receive the information whether:
            <ul>
                <li>the <b>price</b> is below 5’000 CHF</li>
                <li>the <b>mileage</b> is below 100’000 km</li>
                <li>the car has a <b>registration date</b> after 2014</li>
                <li>the car has <b>seat heating</b></li><br>
            </ul>
            Asterisks illustrate <b>YES</b> the criterion is met and hyphens illustrate <b>NO</b>, the criterion is not met.<br>
            <br>In the presented example, <b>Car A</b> doesn't cost less than 5’000 CHF, doesn't have a mileage below 100’000 km and
            its first registration was before 2014. However, it does have seat heating.<br>
            <br><b>Car B</b> costs less than 5’000 CHF, doesn't have a mileage below 100’000 km,
            was initially registered after 2014 and has seat heating.<br>
            <h1 style="color: red;" align="center"><font size="4">Now you are asked to decide which of the two cars you would prefer.</font></h1>
            <br>If you feel ready to make this choice click on the <b>continue</b> button.<br>
            <br>Some of you will then also receive an additional recommendation by a car dealer
            before they can make their choice.
            After you have made you choice, we will finally ask you for your gender, age group and student status.<br>
            <br>Have you understood the instructions? Please ask the experimenter for help if you have additional questions.
            If not, click the <b>continue</b> button to start the experiment!<br>
